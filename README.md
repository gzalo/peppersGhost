# peppersGhost
One common drawback of using the Pepper's Ghost effect is that it requires very thin glass or other suitable material, because otherwise a double image is seen, product of the reflection on both surfaces of the used sheet. Hence more expensive and hard to find materials are needed, for instance dark acrylic or glasses with anti-reflection coating.

This project attempts to compensate that effect, by modifying the image or video to be used in the effect, using OpenGL for accelerated filtering.

Sample results (Left is before, right is after) with 5mm glass:

As it can be seen, some artifacts remain (they can be fine-tuned until they dissapear) but it's less distracting.
